# Frontend Developer Challenge - README

## Introduction
Welcome to my submission for the frontend developer challenge as part of the recruitment process for Dhaka Popular Travel Ltd. 

## Task Overview
The task provided by Dhaka Popular Travel Ltd involved creating a frontend application according to the specifications outlined in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/PositiveZahid/dpt-circular3-frontend-developer).

## Approach
In tackling this challenge, I focused on using React.js for building the frontend components and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS

## Time Taken
This task took approximately 1 hour 40 minutes, give or take 5 minutes, to complete.

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ridz-shadow/dhaka-popular-travel-ltd.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Install dependencies by running the command:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

The development version of the application will be served locally, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

To run the application in a production environment, skip the step 4 and follow these additional steps:

4. Build the production-ready bundle by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

5. Install serve globally by running:

```bash
npm install -g serve
```

6. Serve the built files using serve:

```bash
serve -s build
```

The application will be served in production mode, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Sample Works

I'm accustomed to working with Google Cloud Source Repositories, which are completely private. Unfortunately, I can't share the repositories at the moment. However, here are links to two sample works I've done previously:

1. BDCricTime: [Website Link](https://www.bdcrictime.com)
2. Recent Work - Eimattro: [Website Link](https://admin.eimattro.com) (Still under development)

## Conclusion

I am confident that my submission reflects my proficiency in React.js and Tailwind CSS, as well as my ability to deliver high-quality frontend solutions.
